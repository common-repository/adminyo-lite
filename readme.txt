Adminyo is a powerful time-saving toolbox. Pinned posts in the dashboard makes it easy to revisit posts. The search feature quickly highlights pages, posts, and custom post types. The floating action button places scrolling and publishing buttons at your fingertips. The miscellaneous tools lets you create your own shortcuts, hide the dashboard menu, save by using Ctrl+S, and more.

1) Pin to Dashboard - Shortcuts to Dashboard
Blogs, eCommerce websites, pages under construction. Regardless of the site type, we all want the fastest way to access Custom Post Types (e.g. Posts, Pages, Products), to view, edit or get specific info. This is the tool you need to speed your work up!

2) Quick Search - HyperSpeed Access to Posts, Pages, Products or any Custom Post Types

3) Floating Action Button - Update, Preview, Pin Your Posts. Smart and Easy.
